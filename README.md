## Data Scientist

Combination of three different skill sets:

1. Statistics, Math, Machine Learning
2. Software, Programming, Coding
3. Data Instinct, Domain Knowledge, Data Intuition

---

### Machine Learning

Combination of two perspectives:

1. Statistics: Understanding data and data analysis
2. Computer Science: Pattern Recognition

_Note_: Bias transfers from humans to computers (humans are the creators of the data!)

---

#### Deep Learning

Barriers to DL:

1. Requires a lot of data
2. Computing Power
3. The Why and How of predictions are unknown

---

#### scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for Python. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithm.
